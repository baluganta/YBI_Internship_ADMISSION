# YBI Foundation Internship

# IMPORT LIBRARY
import pandas as pd

# IMPORT DATA
admission = pd.read_csv('https://github.com/ybifoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Admission%20Chance.csv')

# Display first few rows of the dataset
admission.head()

# Display information about the dataset, including data types and non-null counts
admission.info()

# Display summary statistics for numerical columns in the dataset
admission.describe()

# DEFINE TARGET (Y) AND FEATURES(X)
y = admission['Chance of Admit ']
x = admission.drop(['Chance of Admit '], axis=1)

# Display column names of the dataset
admission.columns

# TRAIN TEST SPLIT
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, train_size=0.7, random_state=2529)

# Check shape of train and test samples
x_train.shape, x_test.shape, y_train.shape, y_test.shape

# SELECT MODEL
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()

# TRAIN OR FIT MODEL
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Display the instantiated LinearRegression model
LinearRegression()

# Display the intercept of the trained model
model.intercept_

# Display the coefficients of the trained model
model.coef_

# PREDICT MODEL
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
y_pred

# MODEL ACCURACY
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_absolute_percentage_error, mean_squared_error

# Calculate mean absolute error (MAE)
mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Calculate mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Calculate mean squared error (MSE)
mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
